## Requirements

It is highly recommended that you have the following plugins installed:

* [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/)
* [BetterBibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)

I have not tested without them, so I can't guarantee nothing will break.

## Install

You can install the plugin in Zotero as described [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins):

> To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your computer. Then, in Zotero, click “Tools → Add-Ons”, then drag the `.xpi` for the plugin onto the Add-Ons window that opens

You can grab the latest version of `zotero-mdnotes` [here](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes/releases/latest).

## Update

You can update .xpi package automatically through the zotero app or manually update it.
On the top menu bar click on `Tools` >> `AddOns` and you the following page.
